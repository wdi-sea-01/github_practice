#Github Pull Assignments

Today we will be practicing doing a pull request on a project. You will pair up with another student, and create two pull requests. 1 for a bug on a branch, 1 for a new feature on another branch.


##Getting started
1. Find a partner to pair with, and exchange github urls of either the BOG or LINKBOARD app

2. Do a fork of their project, and clone down the fork

3. Run `bundle` and `rake db:migrate` to get their project working.

4. Add any necessary users, and data needed to get project working.


##Make a pull request

1. Create a new branch on your local copy. `git checkout -b taco`. Where taco is a descriptive name of what you will do in your branch.

2. After you are done with making changes, run `git push origin taco`

3. Then log into github and click make a pull request.


##Accepting a pull request

1. On your dashboard you will see incoming pull requests. Here you can choose to examine all 

2. Make sure all the code that is needed to be edited has been touched, and nothing more.

3. You can make comments, before accepting the pull request.
